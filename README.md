This is a game for the Game Design course. <br>
Our team decided to make a 2D Point N Click Adventure Game within Unity. <br>

All of the visual assets have been provided by our art student team.

I was responsible for the items, inventory, drag n drop mechanic, "ingame cutscenes", state management, animations and a lot of bugfixes.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress - there are still things to be refactored like state management and some things with the Drag N Drop mech for better time-space efficiency.
